# cmpe321-Boun-Registration
3rd project of the CMPE321 lecture. Simple Boun Registration System

First, you need to make sure that you are in the folder we sent called "2018400012_2018400033". If not, you can do so by simply typing following command to terminal: "cd 2018400012_2018400033"

To make our file's size less than 2MB, we did not include "node_modules" file in our project submission. You need to install all necessary modules simply by typing following command to terminal when you are under directory called "2018400012_2018400033":
"npm install"

To execute this program, you need to enter to "src" directory. You can do so by typing "cd src" in terminal.

Under this directory, there is a file named ".env". Go into that file and configure necessary fields.

Then, under "src" directory you need to type following command in terminal to execute this application: "node app.js"

Now, the application is running, you can enter "http://localhost:3000" on your browser to reach the UI we designed.
