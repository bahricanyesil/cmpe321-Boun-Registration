# cmpe321-Boun-Registration
3rd project of the CMPE321 lecture. Simple Boun Registration System

To execute this program, you need to enter to "src" directory. You can do so by typing "cd src" in terminal.

To make our file's size less than 2MB, we did not include "node_modules" file in our project submission. You can install all necessary modules simply by typing following command to terminal:
npm install

Under this directory, there is a file named ".env". Go into that file and configure necessary fields.

Then, under "src" directory you need to type following command in terminal to execute this application: "node app.js"

Now, the application is running, you can enter "http://localhost:3000" on your browser to reach UI we designed.
